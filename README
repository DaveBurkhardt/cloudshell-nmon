--- [ Building ] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To compile this you will need ncurses-dev installed.
To build simply type "make" with the repo after you have pulled it.
Doing a manual install you will want to copy the font file (miniwi-8.psf.gz) into /usr/share/consolefonts

Making this fit on the screen requires using a small font called miniwi-8.  It's included (miniwi-8.psf.gz)
Font Origin:  https://github.com/josuah/miniwi

--- [ Files ] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cloudshell-nmon:  This script will set the small font and get the app running on /dev/tty8 (unused console)
cloudshell-nmon.deb:  Debian package compiled for Xu4; see my NOTE below before using
lmon.c:  C source of NMON modified/tweaked for Xu4
makefile:  makefile to build
miniwi-8.psf.gz:  Tiny font!
nmon-xu4:  ARMv7 binary compiled from lmon.c source

--- [ Installing debian package ] -------------------------------------------------------------
Please see my notes below before using the package :)

   $sudo dpkg -i cloudshell-nmon.deb


--- [ Usage ] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALL of this assumes you have the Cloudshell LCD working via it's module: fb_ili9340.  Now you can use the nmon-xu4 without the module to run in terminal; if that is all you want all you need is the binary file.


--- [ NOTES ] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have cloudshell-lcd installed and running it will conflict with my package.  You will need to either.

A) Disable cloudshell-lcd via
   $sudo service cloudshell-lcd stop
   $sudo systemctl disable cloudshell-nmon.service 

B) Remove the cloudshell-lcd package  (this will not harm anything else other than it removes the LCD shell script)
   $sudo dkg --remove cloudshell-lcd

--- [ CHANGELOG ] -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added option command 'x'  for Xu4 Temperature and CPU
Added option command 'f' to show memory free like 'free' command does
Modified 'd/D' function to supress the 'boot' devices (don't care to waste space seeing these).
Modified source to not output the network errors on start
Tweaked color/formatting
