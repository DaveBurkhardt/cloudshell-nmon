To compile this you will need ncurses-dev installed.

As well making this fit on the screen requires using a small font called miniwi-8.  It's included here.
Font Origin:  https://github.com/josuah/miniwi

To build simply type "make" with the repo.

cloudshell-nmon:  This script will set the small font and get the app running on /dev/tty8 (unused console)

Manual install you will want to copy the font file (miniwi-8.psf.gz) into /usr/share/consolefonts

Of course this all assumes you have the Cloudshell LCD working via it's module: fb_ili9340

** NOTE about debian package **
If you have cloudshell-lcd installed and running it will conflict with my package.  You will need to either.

A) Disable cloudshell-lcd via
   $sudo service cloudshell-lcd stop
   $sudo systemctl disable cloudshell-nmon.service 

B) Remove the cloudshell-lcd package  (this will not harm anything else other than it removes the LCD shell script)
   $sudo dkg --remove cloudshell-lcd
